    "We will explore autoencoder networks using the **Sign Language MNIST** dataset from Kaggle (as same as CA1).

The standard split includes 27,455 training images and 7,172 test images\n",

    " - The encoder takes in the input data and maps it to a lower-dimensional latent representation. It typically consists of multiple layers that gradually reduce the dimensionality of the input data, capturing its essential features. The output of the encoder is a compressed representation of the input, often referred to as a code or latent vector.\n",
    " - The decoder, on the other hand, takes the code from the encoder and reconstructs the original data from it. It mirrors the architecture of the encoder by gradually expanding the code back to the original dimensionality. The output of the decoder is a reconstruction of the input data, which ideally should closely resemble the original input."

    "### **Task 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to simple autoencoders, which aim to learn a deterministic mapping from input data to a compressed latent space and back, **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** introduce a probabilistic approach to the latent space. While simple autoencoders can reconstruct data effectively, they are not inherently capable of generating new, realistic data samples. VAEs, on the other hand, are designed for _both reconstruction and generation_ of novel data samples, making them highly useful for generative modeling tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why VAEs?** A simple autoencoder maps input data to a fixed point in the latent space, meaning that each input has a single corresponding latent vector. While this approach works well for compression and reconstruction, it lacks the ability to generalize and generate new data points because the latent space is not continuous or well-structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a Variational Autoencoder treats the latent space probabilistically. Instead of mapping each input to a single point, it maps inputs to a distribution (typically a Gaussian distribution) in the latent space. This probabilistic treatment allows for the generation of new samples by sampling from the learned distribution, thus enabling the model to create *new*, unseen data points that resemble the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How VAEs Work?** In a VAE, the _encoder_ maps the input data to <u>two</u> vectors: a _mean vector_ and a _variance (or log variance) vector_ (in contrast to one as in a traditional AE). These vectors representing a Gaussian distribution in the latent space. Instead of encoding to a fixed point, the model <u>samples</u> a latent vector from this distribution, using these mean and variance parameters. This sampling introduces variability, allowing the VAE to explore different parts of the latent space and generate diverse outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _decoder_ then reconstructs the data by decoding from the sampled latent vector, which can either come from the encoded input or be randomly generated. This process makes VAEs ideal for generating novel data samples in applications like image generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The loss function?** The loss function plays a crucial role in training the model to both reconstruct input data and ensure that the latent space is properly structured. The VAE loss function consists of two main components:\n",
    "# 1. Reconstruction Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures how well the VAE is able to reconstruct the input data from the latent space.  \n",
    "Typically, this is computed using **binary cross-entropy** (for normalized image data) or **mean squared error** (for continuous data).  \n",

    "- $x_i$ is the original data point (e.g., pixel value)  \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Role of KL Divergence** A crucial aspect of training VAEs is ensuring that the latent space is well-structured and that the learned distributions align with a _prior distribution_ (typically a standard normal distribution). This is where the _Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss_ comes in. KL divergence measures how different the learned distribution is from the desired prior distribution. By minimizing KL divergence during training, the VAE ensures that the latent space follows a continuous, smooth distribution, making it easier to generate realistic new samples by sampling from this space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, VAEs combine the strengths of autoencoders for reconstruction with a probabilistic latent space, enabling the generation of new data samples and ensuring smooth interpolation within the latent space through the use of KL divergence. This combination makes VAEs a powerful generative model in unsupervised learning tasks.\n",
